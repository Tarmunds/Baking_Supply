# Baking Supply Addon for Blender

Welcome to **Baking Supply**, a small but powerful Blender addon designed to streamline your baking workflow by simplifying the back-and-forth process between Blender and your baking software. This addon is released under the GNU General Public License v3.

### Features

- **Hide Low/High Meshes**: Automatically detect and hide all meshes with `_low` or `_high` in their names, depending on the button you click.
- **Show Low/High Meshes**: Easily bring back visibility for low or high meshes with a single click.
- **Export Meshes**: Export all selected meshes marked with `_high` or `_low` to the location of your Blender file, using a name that you can set directly in the panel.
- **Custom Export Path**: You can also define a custom path for exporting. If left empty, the addon will export the files to the same location as your Blender file.

### How to Use
1. **Hide/Show Meshes**: Use the Hide/Show buttons to quickly adjust the visibility of high and low meshes for easier navigation and manipulation.
2. **Exporting Meshes**: Enter a name in the panel, then use the export buttons to save all visible high or low meshes. Specify a custom path if needed.

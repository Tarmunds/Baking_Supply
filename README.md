# Baking Supply Addon for Blender

Welcome to **Baking Supply**, a small but powerful Blender addon designed to streamline your baking workflow by simplifying the back-and-forth process between Blender and your baking software. 
This addon was designed with the use of the [Quick Loader feature of Marmoset Toolbag](https://docs.marmoset.co/docs/baking-attributes/), but can be use with any other baking software.
This addon is released under the GNU General Public License v3.

### Features

- **Hide Low/High Meshes**: Automatically detect and hide all meshes with `_low` or `_high` in their names, depending on the button you click.
- **Show Low/High Meshes**: Easily bring back visibility for low or high meshes with a single click.
- **Switch Suffix (`_high` <> `_low`)**: Quickly switch between `_high` and `_low` suffixes for selected objects, making it easy to manage naming conventions during your workflow.
- **Add Suffix (`_high` or `_low`)**: Add a `_high` or `_low` suffix to selected mesh objects to ensure they follow the correct naming convention.
- **Transfer Names**: Transfer the name from an active `_high` object to other selected objects, replacing `_high` with `_low` for consistent naming.
- **Export Meshes**: Export all visible meshes marked with `_high` or `_low` to the location of your Blender file, using a name that you can set directly in the panel. After exporting, the original selection will be restored.
- **Custom Export Path**: You can also define a custom path for exporting. If left empty, the addon will export the files to the same location as your Blender file.

Hey this is a little addon made on blender for ease the baking worflow, with back and forth beteween your baking software and blender.

this is under the gnu3 licence


the use is quite simple :

    - Hide low/high will detect all the current mesh with the _low or _high depending of the buttons, and Hide them
    - Show low/high will do the same, and Show them

    - the export buttons will export all visible meshes with _high / _low and export them as the location of the blend files with the naming you can provide on the panel
    - in the export option you can setup a custom path, if empty, it will export at the blend file location
